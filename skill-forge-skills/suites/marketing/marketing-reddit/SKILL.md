# Marketing Reddit — Community Marketing Without Getting Banned

## Skill Configuration

**Version:** 1.0.0

**Triggers:**
- "Reddit post", "post on Reddit", "Reddit marketing"
- "subreddit", "which subreddit", "Reddit community"
- "share on Reddit without getting banned"
- "Reddit self-promotion", "Reddit launch"

**Quick Triggers:**
- `reddit post for [product]` → Generate value-first post
- `find subreddits for [topic]` → Identify relevant communities
- `reddit launch strategy` → Pre-launch community building plan
- `reddit comment for [thread]` → Helpful comment that builds credibility

**Smart Defaults:**
- Approach: value-first, self-promotion last
- Ratio: 90% giving, 10% asking (minimum)
- Tone: authentic Redditor, not marketer
- Timeline: long-term community building, not quick wins

## Section 1: Understanding Reddit Culture

### The Golden Rules
```
1. REDDIT USERS CAN SMELL MARKETING
   └── They've seen every tactic. They're immune. Don't try to be clever.

2. VALUE MUST PRECEDE ANY ASK
   └── Weeks or months of genuine contribution before any self-promotion.

3. EVERY SUBREDDIT IS DIFFERENT
   └── Rules, culture, acceptable content vary wildly. Read before posting.

4. YOUR POST HISTORY IS PUBLIC
   └── Mods and users check. If it's all self-promo, you're done.

5. AUTHENTICITY IS THE ONLY STRATEGY
   └── Be a person, not a brand. Share struggles, help others, ask questions.
```

### The 90/10 Rule (Minimum)
```
FOR EVERY SELF-PROMOTIONAL POST OR COMMENT:

You need at least 9 genuine, helpful contributions:
├── Answering questions in your expertise area
├── Sharing resources (not your own) that help people
├── Engaging in discussions with genuine opinions
├── Asking questions (you genuinely want answered)
├── Giving feedback on others' projects
├── Sharing experiences without any product mention
├── Celebrating others' wins
├── Participating in community threads
└── Being a normal human on the internet

Reality: 95/5 is safer. Some subreddits require 99/1.
```

### What Gets You Banned
```
INSTANT BAN TRIGGERS:
├── First post is self-promotion
├── Multiple posts about same product
├── Commenting "check out my [product]" on threads
├── Having post history that's only self-promotion
├── Astroturfing (fake accounts, fake reviews)
├── Vote manipulation (asking friends to upvote)
└── Ignoring subreddit rules

SLOW BAN TRIGGERS:
├── Subtly steering conversations to your product
├── "I actually built something for this" too often
├── Only engaging with threads where you can plug yourself
├── Defensive responses to criticism
└── Not disclosing affiliation when it's relevant
```

---

## Section 2: Finding the Right Subreddits

### Subreddit Research Framework
```
STEP 1: IDENTIFY CANDIDATE SUBREDDITS
├── Search Reddit for your product category
├── Look at where competitors/similar products are discussed
├── Find where your target users ask questions
├── Check related subreddits in sidebars
└── Search "[your niche] reddit" on Google

STEP 2: EVALUATE EACH SUBREDDIT
├── Size: 10K-500K often best (not too big, not dead)
├── Activity: Posts getting comments in last 24 hours?
├── Rules: Read sidebar AND wiki completely
├── Culture: Lurk for 2 weeks before posting anything
├── Self-promo policy: Some ban it entirely, some have specific days/threads
└── Mod activity: Are rules enforced? Are mods responsive?

STEP 3: CATEGORIZE BY ENGAGEMENT TYPE
├── PRIMARY: Where your exact users hang out
├── SECONDARY: Adjacent communities with some overlap
├── TERTIARY: Broad communities where you can occasionally contribute
└── AVOID: Communities that explicitly ban your type of content
```

### Common Subreddit Categories for Dev Products
```
MAKER/BUILDER COMMUNITIES:
├── r/SideProject — For sharing side projects (self-promo allowed)
├── r/InternetIsBeautiful — For genuinely cool web tools
├── r/indiehackers — Building products, monetization
├── r/startups — Startup discussion (strict rules)
└── r/Entrepreneur — Business building (very strict)

FEEDBACK COMMUNITIES:
├── r/RoastMyStartup — Brutally honest feedback
├── r/alphaandbetausers — Finding beta testers
├── r/Design_Critiques — Design feedback
└── r/webdev + r/web_design — Technical feedback

NICHE TECHNICAL:
├── r/[your language] — Python, JavaScript, Rust, etc.
├── r/[your framework] — React, Django, Rails, etc.
├── r/[your domain] — DevOps, DataScience, MachineLearning, etc.
└── r/selfhosted — For self-hostable products

LAUNCH COMMUNITIES:
├── r/SideProject — Launches welcome
├── r/IMadeThis — Show what you built
├── r/AlphaAndBetaUsers — Beta launches specifically
└── Note: Most other subreddits do NOT want launches
```

---

## Section 3: The Long-Term Reddit Strategy

### Phase 1: Lurk and Learn (Weeks 1-4)
```
DO:
├── Subscribe to target subreddits
├── Read posts daily without engaging
├── Note what gets upvoted vs downvoted
├── Read ALL rules, wiki, pinned posts
├── Identify frequent posters and their style
├── Notice what questions come up repeatedly
└── Save threads where you could have helped

DON'T:
├── Post anything yet
├── Comment with product mentions
├── Message mods about self-promotion rules
└── Assume you understand the culture quickly
```

### Phase 2: Genuine Contribution (Weeks 5-12)
```
DO:
├── Answer questions in your expertise area
├── Share resources (not yours) that help people
├── Ask genuine questions you want answered
├── Engage in discussions with real opinions
├── Give feedback on others' projects
├── Be helpful without ANY product mention
├── Let your comment history build credibility
└── Respond to comments on your contributions

DON'T:
├── Mention your product yet
├── Steer conversations toward your solution
├── Help only on threads where your product is relevant
└── Be frustrated that you can't promote yet
```

### Phase 3: Subtle Relevance (Months 3-6)
```
DO:
├── Continue 95%+ genuine contribution
├── When DIRECTLY ASKED about tools, mention yours among others
├── Share genuine experiences that involve your product
├── Add to profile: what you're building (people check)
├── Respond to "I wish X existed" if your product is X
└── Always disclose you built it when mentioning it

DON'T:
├── Create posts about your product
├── Comment "I built something for this!" on every thread
├── Pretend to be a user discovering your product
├── Get defensive about any criticism
└── Over-index on threads where you can plug yourself
```

### Phase 4: Earned Promotion (Month 6+)
```
Only after establishing genuine presence:

IN APPROPRIATE SUBREDDITS (r/SideProject, etc.):
├── Share your launch story (focus on journey, not features)
├── Ask for feedback (genuine, not disguised promo)
├── Share milestones with lessons learned
└── Respond to every comment, especially criticism

IN GENERAL SUBREDDITS:
├── Only mention product when directly relevant
├── Always disclose you built it
├── Frame as "I built this" not "check out this cool product"
├── Accept criticism gracefully
└── Never argue with negative feedback
```

---

## Section 4: Writing Reddit Posts

### Post Structure: The Value-First Launch
```
[TITLE: Specific, honest, not clickbait]

I built [product] because [genuine problem you had]

[1-2 sentences of context about the problem]

Here's what I learned building it:
- [Genuine insight 1]
- [Genuine insight 2]
- [Genuine insight 3]

The tool is [brief description]. [Link]

I'd love feedback, especially on:
- [Specific question 1]
- [Specific question 2]

Happy to answer any questions about the tech/journey.

[Disclose: I'm the creator]
```

### Post Structure: The Genuine Help Post
```
[TITLE: Describes what you're sharing, not selling]

I've been [doing activity] for [time] and learned some things 
that might help others:

[Valuable content that stands alone]

[If relevant:] I actually ended up building a tool for this 
because I was doing it so much. Happy to share if anyone's 
interested, but the above process works without any tools.
```

### Post Structure: Asking for Feedback
```
[TITLE: "Feedback wanted" or "Roast my X" — honest about intent]

I'm building [product] for [audience] and would genuinely love 
harsh feedback.

Background: [Why you're building this]

What it does: [Brief explanation]

Here's the site/demo: [Link]

Specific questions:
1. [Genuine question you want answered]
2. [Another genuine question]

I can take harsh criticism — that's why I'm here.

[Respond to EVERY comment, especially negative ones]
```

### Title Formulas That Work
```
HONEST AND SPECIFIC:
✅ "I built a tool to [specific function] — looking for feedback"
✅ "After 6 months of [problem], I made [solution]"
✅ "Show Reddit: [Product] — [one-line description]"

AVOID:
❌ "Check out my amazing new app!"
❌ "This will change how you [activity]!"
❌ "Why isn't everyone using this?"
❌ "My startup is going viral" (no it isn't)
```

---

## Section 5: Writing Reddit Comments

### The Helpful Comment Template
```
When someone asks a question you can answer:

[Direct answer to their question]

[Additional context if helpful]

[Personal experience if relevant: "I ran into this when..."]

[If your product is DIRECTLY relevant and you've established presence:]
"I actually built a tool for this — [link] — but [alternative approach] 
works too if you don't want another tool."
```

### The "I Built Something" Comment (Use Sparingly)
```
When someone says "I wish X existed" and you built X:

"I actually built something for this: [link]

Full disclosure: I'm the creator.

It does [specific thing they mentioned]. 

Happy to answer questions, and if it's not quite what you need, 
[alternative] might work too."
```

### Comment Anti-Patterns
```
❌ "Check out [my product]!" (spam)
❌ "This is exactly why I built [product]" on every thread
❌ "Shameless plug but..." (still spam)
❌ Copying and pasting the same comment
❌ Only commenting on threads where you can plug yourself
❌ Getting defensive when someone criticizes your product
```

---

## Section 6: Handling Criticism on Reddit

### The Reddit Critic Response Framework
```
WHEN SOMEONE CRITICIZES YOUR PRODUCT:

1. THANK THEM (genuinely)
   "Thanks for the feedback — this is exactly why I posted here."

2. ACKNOWLEDGE THE ISSUE
   "You're right, the [feature] could be better."

3. EXPLAIN (briefly) OR AGREE
   "I prioritized X over Y because [reason], but I see how that's a problem."
   OR "Yeah, that's a gap. Adding it to the list."

4. DON'T DEFEND
   Never argue. Never explain why they're wrong. Even if they are.

5. FOLLOW UP (if you fix it)
   "Hey, wanted to let you know I fixed [issue] you mentioned. Thanks again."
```

### When to NOT Respond
```
DON'T RESPOND TO:
├── Trolls (obvious bad faith)
├── Personal attacks (report instead)
├── Comments that will derail into argument
└── Anything that tempts you to be defensive

DO RESPOND TO:
├── Genuine criticism (thank them)
├── Questions (answer thoroughly)
├── Feature requests (acknowledge, don't promise)
├── "This already exists" (acknowledge the alternative)
└── Positive feedback (brief thanks, not effusive)
```

---

## Section 7: Subreddit-Specific Guidelines

### r/SideProject
```
ALLOWED: Launch posts, progress updates, asking for feedback
CULTURE: Supportive of makers, but must be side project (not VC-backed)
TIPS:
├── Lead with the journey, not the product
├── Share actual numbers if you have them
├── Ask specific feedback questions
└── Engage with everyone who comments
```

### r/startups
```
ALLOWED: Very limited self-promotion, mostly discussion
CULTURE: Serious, business-focused, hates hype
TIPS:
├── Contribute to discussions for weeks first
├── Self-promo only in designated threads
├── Focus on lessons learned, not product features
└── Be ready for harsh feedback
```

### r/webdev, r/javascript, r/python, etc.
```

TIPS:
├── Help others with technical questions first
├── When sharing tools, focus on technical implementation
├── Be ready to discuss the tech stack in detail
└── Open source components help credibility
```

### r/Entrepreneur
```
ALLOWED: Very strict, almost no self-promotion

## Section 8: Guardrails

### What This Skill Does NOT Do
- Create sneaky or manipulative posts
- Help astroturf or fake engagement
- Write posts that ignore subreddit rules
- Promise quick results from Reddit marketing
- Encourage spammy cross-posting

### Quality Floors
- Every post must provide standalone value
- Self-promotion must be disclosed
- Must recommend lurking/contribution period first
- Must check subreddit-specific rules

### Boundaries
- Will not help game Reddit's systems
- Will not write posts for subreddits that ban the content type
- Will recommend against Reddit if it's not right for the product
- Will always recommend genuine community participation first

---

## Section 9: Examples

### Example 1: SideProject Launch Post

**Input:** "Write a Reddit post for r/SideProject launching my API monitoring tool"

**Output:**
```
Title: After my API went down for 3 hours and I didn't notice, 
       I built my own monitoring tool

Six months ago, my main product's API went down. I was asleep. 
My users were not.

By the time I woke up, I had 47 angry emails and probably lost 
a few customers permanently.

I tried existing monitoring tools but they were either:
- Too expensive for a solo dev ($100+/month)
- Too complicated (I just want to know if it's down)
- Too slow (15-minute check intervals)

So I built PingCheck (I'm the creator, full disclosure).

What I learned building it:
- Uptime monitoring is deceptively complex
- "Simple" is really hard to achieve
- Most people don't need 90% of monitoring features

It's free for up to 5 endpoints with 1-minute checks. 
No credit card required.

Site: [link]

I'd genuinely love feedback on:
1. Is the pricing page clear? I've rewritten it 4 times.
2. Missing any must-have features?
3. Would you trust a solo-dev tool for monitoring?

Happy to answer any questions about the tech stack or the journey.
Also happy to hear "this already exists" — always good to know 
what I'm competing with.
```

### Example 2: Helpful Comment (No Self-Promotion)

**Input:** "Write a helpful Reddit comment for someone asking about 
          API rate limiting strategies"

**Output:**
```
Rate limiting is one of those "simple in theory, tricky in practice" problems.

Here's what's worked for me:

**For most APIs, token bucket works great:**
- Give each client X tokens that refill at Y per second
- Each request costs 1 token (or more for expensive operations)
- Return 429 when empty, with Retry-After header

**Implementation-wise:**
- Redis is the go-to for distributed systems (INCR with TTL)
- In-memory works fine for single instances (node-rate-limiter-flexible is solid)
- Don't roll your own crypto, but DO roll your own rate limiter — it's not that hard

**Common mistakes I've made:**
- Forgetting to rate limit by user AND by IP (bots create many accounts)
- Rate limiting too aggressively early on (annoyed real users)
- Not having clear documentation on limits

What's your architecture? Single server or distributed? That'll change 
the recommendation.
```

### Example 3: Feedback Request

**Input:** "Write a post asking for feedback on my landing page for r/web_design"

**Output:**
```
Title: Landing page feedback request — trying to explain a 
       technical product simply

I've been struggling to explain what my product does without 
getting too technical. Would love some design/copy feedback.

**The product:** A code review tool for solo developers 
(I'm the creator)

**The problem I'm solving:** Solo devs don't have teammates 
to review their code

**Landing page:** [link]

**Specific questions:**

1. Does the hero section make sense in under 5 seconds?
2. Is there too much text? I keep cutting and it still feels long.
3. The demo GIF in section 2 — helpful or distracting?
4. Mobile experience — I tested but would love other eyes on it

I can take harsh feedback. "This sucks because X" is more helpful 
than "looks good!"

Built with [tech stack] if anyone's curious about the implementation.

Thanks in advance 🙏
```
