## Section 1: The Positioning Foundation

Before any marketing activity, you need to answer these questions:

### The Positioning Statement
```
FOR [target customer]
WHO [has this problem/need]
[Product name] IS A [category]
THAT [key benefit/differentiation]
UNLIKE [primary alternative]
OUR PRODUCT [primary differentiation]
```

**Example:**
```
FOR solo developers
WHO need code reviews but don't have teammates
CodeReview Pro IS A code analysis tool
THAT catches bugs and suggests improvements automatically
UNLIKE traditional code review tools that require human reviewers
OUR PRODUCT gives you expert-level feedback in seconds, 24/7
```

### The One-Sentence Pitch
```
FORMULA: I help [specific audience] [achieve outcome] without [pain point]

EXAMPLES:
- "I help freelancers get paid faster without chasing invoices"
- "I help solo devs ship better code without waiting for reviews"
- "I help remote teams stay aligned without more meetings"
```

### The Big Idea (Ogilvy's Framework)

David Ogilvy's most crucial concept: every great campaign has ONE Big Idea.

```
"You will never win fame and fortune unless you invent big ideas. 
 It takes a big idea to attract the attention of consumers and 
 get them to buy your product. Unless your advertising contains 
 a big idea, it will pass like a ship in the night."
 — David Ogilvy

THE BIG IDEA TEST:
├── Does it make you gasp when you first see it?
├── Do you wish you had thought of it yourself?
├── Is it unique?
├── Does it fit the strategy to perfection?
└── Could it be used for 30 years?

FINDING YOUR BIG IDEA:
├── What is the ONE truth about your product that matters most?
├── What can you say that NO competitor can say?
├── What would make your ideal customer stop scrolling?
├── What belief do you want to change in their mind?
└── What's the surprising truth about the problem you solve?

EXAMPLES OF BIG IDEAS:
├── "Rolls-Royce: At 60 mph the loudest noise comes from the electric clock"
│   └── Big Idea: Unparalleled engineering precision
├── "Dove: 1/4 moisturizing cream"  
│   └── Big Idea: This soap is different (doesn't dry skin)
├── "Stripe: Payments infrastructure for the internet"
│   └── Big Idea: We handle the complexity so you don't have to

YOUR BIG IDEA FORMULA:
"[Product] is the only [category] that [unique differentiator] 
 so you can [ultimate benefit]"

Example: "CodeReview Pro is the only code review tool that gives 
you expert-level feedback in seconds, so you can ship with 
confidence even without a team."
```

### Positioning Diagnostic Questions
```
Answer these before any strategy work:

1. WHO is this for? (Be specific — "developers" is too broad)
   └── Example: "Solo developers building SaaS products"

2. WHAT problem does it solve? (Their words, not yours)
   └── Example: "No one to review my code, shipping with anxiety"

3. WHY is the current solution inadequate? (The gap you fill)
   └── Example: "Existing tools need human reviewers or cost $500+/mo"

4. WHAT makes you different? (Honest differentiation)
   └── Example: "AI reviews in seconds, priced for individuals"

5. WHY should they trust you? (Credibility, proof, story)
   └── Example: "I was a solo dev who shipped buggy code for years"
```

---

## Section 2: Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### The Research Imperative (Ogilvy's Foundation)

```
"Advertising people who ignore research are as dangerous as 
 generals who ignore decodes of enemy signals."
 — David Ogilvy

Before spending ANY time on marketing tactics, research:
├── Talk to 5-10 potential customers (not friends/family)
├── Read where they complain (Reddit, Twitter, forums)
├── Study how they describe the problem (use their words)
├── Understand what they've tried that failed
└── Learn what would make them switch/pay

THE SOLO DEV RESEARCH CHEAT:
├── Search Reddit for "[your problem] frustrating"
├── Read 1-star reviews of competitors
├── Search Twitter for "[competitor] sucks" or "[problem] annoying"
├── Look at "Discussions" tabs on competitor GitHub repos
└── Join communities and listen before speaking

This research directly informs your Big Idea, positioning, 
and all marketing copy. Skip it and you're guessing.
```

### The ICP Template
```
WHO THEY ARE:
├── Role/Title: [What they call themselves]
├── Company size: [Solo, small team, enterprise?]
├── Industry/Domain: [If relevant]
└── Technical level: [Beginner, intermediate, expert?]

WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO:
├── Primary goal: [What they're working toward]
├── Current approach: [How they do it now]
└── Trigger event: [What makes them look for solutions]

WHAT FRUSTRATES THEM:
├── Pain point 1: [Specific frustration]
├── Pain point 2: [Another frustration]
└── Failed solutions: [What they've tried that didn't work]

WHERE THEY HANG OUT:
├── Online communities: [Subreddits, Discord, forums]
├── Social platforms: [Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.]
├── Information sources: [Blogs, newsletters, podcasts]
└── Events: [Conferences, meetups]

HOW THEY BUY:
├── Decision process: [Quick impulse vs. long evaluation?]
├── Budget authority: [Personal card or approval needed?]
├── Price sensitivity: [What's expensive/cheap to them?]
└── Risk tolerance: [Early adopter or wait for reviews?]
```

### Example ICP: Solo Dev Code Review Tool
```
WHO THEY ARE:
├── Role: Indie hacker, solo founder, freelance developer
├── Company: Working alone or with 1-2 contractors
├── Domain: Building SaaS, dev tools, or client projects
└── Level: Intermediate to senior developer

WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO:
├── Primary goal: Ship quality code without a team
├── Current approach: Self-review, hope for the best, fix bugs in prod
└── Trigger: Just shipped a bug that cost them a customer

WHAT FRUSTRATES THEM:
├── Pain 1: "I can't see my own blind spots"
├── Pain 2: "Enterprise code review tools are overkill"
└── Failed: Tried asking on Twitter, but feedback is inconsistent

WHERE THEY HANG OUT:
├── Communities: r/SideProject, r/indiehackers, Indie Hackers forum
├── Social: Twitter (tech twitter), LinkedIn
├── Content: HackerNews, dev blogs, Build in Public newsletters
└── Events: Virtual indie maker meetups

HOW THEY BUY:
├── Decision: Quick for cheap tools, more research for $50+/mo
├── Budget: Personal credit card, no approval needed
├── Price: <$20/mo is impulse, >$50/mo needs to prove ROI
└── Risk: Moderate early adopter, wants to see it work first
```

## Section 3: Channel Selection

### The Channel Prioritization Matrix
```
DON'T DO EVERYTHING. Pick 1-2 channels and do them well.

EVALUATE EACH CHANNEL ON:
├── Audience fit: Are your ICPs actually there?
├── Content fit: Does your expertise translate?
├── Time investment: Can you sustain it?
├── Competition: Can you stand out?
└── Compound potential: Does it build over time?

SCORE EACH 1-5, PICK TOP 2 SCORERS
```

## Section 5: The Growth Funnel

### Simple Funnel for Solo Devs
```
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │  AWARENESS  │  ← Content, social, SEO
                    └──────┬──────┘
                           │
                    ┌──────▼──────┐
                    │   INTEREST  │  ← Landing page, docs
                    └──────┬──────┘
                           │
                    ┌──────▼──────┐
                    │    TRIAL    │  ← Free tier, demo
                    └──────┬──────┘
                           │
                    ┌──────▼──────┐
                    │  ACTIVATION │  ← Onboarding, first value
                    └──────┬──────┘
                           │
                    ┌──────▼──────┐
                    │   REVENUE   │  ← Conversion, upgrade
                    └──────┬──────┘
                           │
                    ┌──────▼──────┐
                    │  REFERRAL   │  ← Word of mouth, sharing
                    └─────────────┘
```

### Funnel Metrics to Track
```
AWARENESS → INTEREST:
└── Metric: Website visitors (Google Analytics or Plausible)
└── Benchmark: Growing week over week

INTEREST → TRIAL:
└── Metric: Signup conversion rate
└── Benchmark: 2-5% for landing page visitors

TRIAL → ACTIVATION:
└── Metric: % who complete key action in first session
└── Benchmark: 40-60% should hit activation

ACTIVATION → REVENUE:
└── Metric: Free to paid conversion rate
└── Benchmark: 2-5% for freemium, 10-30% for trial

REVENUE → REFERRAL:
└── Metric: NPS or "how did you hear about us"
└── Benchmark: >30% from word of mouth is healthy
```

### Diagnosing Funnel Problems
```
LOW TRAFFIC, OK CONVERSION:
└── Problem: Not enough awareness
└── Fix: More content, better SEO, community presence

HIGH TRAFFIC, LOW SIGNUPS:
└── Problem: Messaging or positioning mismatch
└── Fix: Landing page copy, targeting, value prop clarity

HIGH SIGNUPS, LOW ACTIVATION:
└── Problem: Onboarding friction or unclear value
└── Fix: Simplify first experience, show value faster

HIGH ACTIVATION, LOW CONVERSION:
└── Problem: Free tier too generous or value not worth paying
└── Fix: Pricing, feature gates, or customer development

LOW REFERRALS:
└── Problem: Product doesn't create share-worthy moments
└── Fix: Add viral mechanics, ask for referrals, improve core product
```

## Section 9: Guardrails

### What This Skill Does NOT Do
- Promise specific results or timelines
- Recommend paid acquisition for bootstrapped solo devs
- Create unrealistic marketing plans
- Suggest channels that don't fit solo constraints
- Ignore product-market fit issues

### Quality Floors
- Every strategy recommendation must be executable by one person
- Time estimates must be realistic (include buffer)
- Channel recommendations must match stated ICP
- Plans must prioritize ruthlessly (no "do everything" advice)

### Boundaries
- Will note when product needs work before marketing
- Will recommend fewer channels, not more
- Will suggest simplifying when plans are too complex
- Will acknowledge when paid help might be necessary

### Example 2: Positioning Exercise

**Input:** "Help me position my invoice automation tool"

**Output:**
```
POSITIONING EXERCISE: Invoice Automation Tool
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Let's work through this step by step:

QUESTION 1: WHO specifically is this for?

Not just "freelancers" — which type?
├── Creative freelancers (designers, writers)?
├── Technical freelancers (developers, consultants)?
├── Service freelancers (coaches, therapists)?
└── All freelancers (harder to target)?

SUGGESTED: Pick ONE to start. You can expand later.

QUESTION 2: WHAT specific problem?

"Invoicing is hard" is too vague. Which pain?
├── Creating invoices takes too long?
├── Chasing late payments is awkward?
├── Tracking what's paid vs unpaid is messy?
├── End-of-year tax prep is a nightmare?
└── Professional-looking invoices are hard to make?

SUGGESTED: Pick the ONE pain that hurts most.

QUESTION 3: WHY are current solutions inadequate?

├── FreshBooks/QuickBooks: Too complex, too expensive
├── Wave: Free but clunky interface
├── Excel/Notion: Manual, unprofessional, no automation
└── [Your differentiation goes here]

BASED ON YOUR ANSWERS, here's a template:

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
POSITIONING STATEMENT:

FOR [freelance developers]
WHO [waste hours every month creating and chasing invoices]
[Product] IS A [simple invoicing tool]
THAT [creates professional invoices in 60 seconds and automatically reminds clients]
UNLIKE [FreshBooks and QuickBooks]
OUR PRODUCT [is built for solo freelancers, not agencies, at a price that makes sense]

ONE-SENTENCE PITCH:
"I help freelance developers get paid faster with one-click invoices and automatic payment reminders."
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Does this direction feel right? What would you adjust?
