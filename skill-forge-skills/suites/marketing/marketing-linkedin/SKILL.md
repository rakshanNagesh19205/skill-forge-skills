# Marketing LinkedIn — Thought Leadership for Solo Developers

## Skill Configuration

**Version:** 1.0.0

**Triggers:**
- "LinkedIn post", "write for LinkedIn", "LinkedIn content"
- "thought leadership", "build my professional brand"
- "B2B content", "professional audience"
- "LinkedIn hook", "engaging LinkedIn post"

**Quick Triggers:**
- `linkedin post about [topic]` → Generate full post with hook
- `linkedin hook for [idea]` → Generate 5 hook variations
- `linkedin carousel [topic]` → Generate carousel slide content
- `linkedin poll [topic]` → Generate poll with strategic options

**Smart Defaults:**
- Tone: authentic, not corporate
- Length: 150-300 words (optimal engagement zone)
- Format: hook + story/insight + takeaway
- CTA: soft (engage/comment), not hard sell
- Posting frequency assumption: 3-5x/week target

## Section 1: The LinkedIn Algorithm (What Actually Matters)

```
ALGORITHM SIGNALS (in priority order):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. DWELL TIME (Most important)
   └── How long people spend reading your post
   └── Implication: Write content worth reading slowly
   └── Tactic: Stories > bullet points for dwell time

2. EARLY ENGAGEMENT (First 60-90 minutes)
   └── Comments > Reactions > Shares
   └── Implication: Post when your audience is active
   └── Tactic: End with genuine question, reply to every comment fast

3. ENGAGEMENT DEPTH
   └── Meaningful comments > "Great post!" reactions
   └── Implication: Write content that sparks discussion
   └── Tactic: Share opinions, experiences, contrarian takes

4. CONTENT COMPLETION
   └── Did people click "see more" AND keep reading?
   └── Implication: Hook matters, but so does payoff
   └── Tactic: Promise in hook, deliver in body

5. PROFILE CONNECTIONS
   └── Do your connections engage? Do their connections engage?
   └── Implication: Build genuine network, not follower count
   └── Tactic: Engage with others' content genuinely
```

---

## Section 2: Hook Formulas That Work

The first 2-3 lines determine whether anyone reads the rest. These formulas consistently perform:

### Pattern 1: Contrarian/Controversial Take
```
[Common belief] is wrong.

Here's what actually works:

[Your insight]
```
**Example:**
```
"Move fast and break things" is terrible advice for solo devs.

Here's why slow and steady wins:

I spent 3 weeks on something I could've shipped in 3 days...
```

### Pattern 2: Confession/Vulnerability
```
I [embarrassing admission].

[What I learned from it]
```
**Example:**
```
I mass-emailed 500 people with "[First Name]" in the subject line.

Turns out my mail merge was broken.

Here's what the 47 people who replied taught me about recovering from mistakes...
```

### Pattern 3: Specific Number + Outcome
```
[Specific number] [timeframe] of [activity].

Here's what [specific result]:

[Breakdown]
```
**Example:**
```
200 days of building in public.

Here's what actually moved the needle:

- Days 1-50: [insight]
- Days 51-100: [insight]
- Days 101-200: [insight]
```

### Pattern 4: Behind-the-Scenes
```
Everyone sees [visible success].

Nobody sees [hidden reality]:

[Honest breakdown]
```
**Example:**
```
Everyone sees: "Hit $5K MRR!"

Nobody sees:
- 14 months of $0
- 3 failed product pivots
- 1 near-complete burnout

Here's the timeline nobody posts about...
```

### Pattern 5: Unexpected Comparison
```
[Your professional topic] is like [unexpected analogy].

Here's why:

[Insight that makes the comparison land]
```
**Example:**
```
Debugging code is like solving a murder mystery.

You have:
- A victim (broken feature)
- Suspects (recent commits)
- Evidence (error logs)
- Red herrings (unrelated warnings)

Here's my detective framework for finding bugs faster...
```

### Pattern 6: Direct Address + Challenge
```
If you're [specific situation], stop [common mistake].

Instead:

[Better approach]
```
**Example:**
```
If you're building a SaaS, stop adding features.

Instead, talk to your churned users.

I just did 15 churn interviews. Here's what they revealed...
```

---

## Section 3: Post Structures

### Structure A: The Story Post (Best for engagement)
```
[HOOK: 1-2 lines that create curiosity]

[CONTEXT: Quick setup, 2-3 sentences]

[TURNING POINT: What changed/went wrong/surprised you]

[LESSON: The insight or takeaway]

[CTA: Question or invitation to discuss]
```

**Length:** 200-300 words
**Best for:** Personal experiences, failures, wins, learnings

### Structure B: The List Post (Best for saves/shares)
```
[HOOK: Promise of value]

[LIST: 5-10 items, each 1-2 sentences]

[BONUS: One extra insight]

[CTA: Ask which resonates most]
```

**Length:** 150-250 words
**Best for:** Tips, tools, frameworks, processes

### Structure C: The Hot Take (Best for comments)
```
[CONTRARIAN HOOK: Challenge conventional wisdom]

[EVIDENCE: Why you believe this, 2-3 points]

[NUANCE: Acknowledge the other side]

[INVITATION: Ask for other perspectives]
```

**Length:** 100-200 words
**Best for:** Industry opinions, trend commentary, philosophy

### Structure D: The Build-in-Public Update
```
[MILESTONE/UPDATE: What happened]

[NUMBERS: Specific metrics]

[LEARNING: What this taught you]

[NEXT: What you're working on]

[ASK: Specific question for feedback]
```

**Length:** 150-200 words
**Best for:** Regular updates, transparency posts

├── Work-life balance
├── Motivation/mindset
├── Humor and relatability
└── Unpopular opinions
```

---

## Section 5: LinkedIn-Specific Formatting

### Line Break Strategy
```
❌ WALL OF TEXT:
This is hard to read on LinkedIn because there are no breaks and people
scroll fast so they won't stop for this even if the content is good
because it looks like too much effort to read.

✅ SCANNABLE FORMAT:
This is much easier to read.

Each thought gets its own line.

Your eye can follow the flow.

And the white space creates breathing room.
```

### Emoji Usage (Subtle, Not Excessive)
```
❌ EMOJI OVERLOAD:
🚀 Just launched! 🎉 So excited! 💪 Let's go! 🔥🔥🔥

✅ STRATEGIC EMOJI:
After 6 months of building, it's finally live.

Here's what I learned:

→ First lesson
→ Second lesson  
→ Third lesson

Link in comments 👇
```

### The "See More" Optimization
```
LinkedIn truncates at ~210 characters. Your hook must:
1. Fit in 210 characters OR
2. Create enough curiosity that people click "see more"

TRUNCATION TEST:
"I almost mass-deleted my database yesterday. Here's what I learned about backup strategies the hard way. [TRUNCATES HERE - see more]"

The reader must NEED to know what comes next.
```

---

## Section 6: Calls to Action That Work

### Soft CTAs (Use most often)
```
✅ "What's your experience with this?"
✅ "Have you run into this problem?"
✅ "What would you add to this list?"
✅ "Agree or disagree?"
✅ "Which of these resonates most?"
```

### Medium CTAs (Use occasionally)
```
✅ "If this was helpful, I share stuff like this every week"
✅ "Link to [resource] in comments"
✅ "I wrote more about this here: [link in comments]"
```

### Hard CTAs (Use sparingly, <10% of posts)
```
⚠️ "Check out [product]" — Only when genuinely relevant
⚠️ "I'm launching X, would love feedback" — Max 1x/month
⚠️ "Sign up for my newsletter" — Earn it first with value
```

### Link Placement
```
❌ Links in post body get suppressed by algorithm
✅ "Link in comments" — Add link as first comment
✅ "Link in bio" — For evergreen content
```

---

## Section 7: Timing and Frequency

### Best Posting Times (B2B/Dev Audience)
```
TIER 1 (Highest engagement):
├── Tuesday 8-10 AM (local time of your audience)
├── Wednesday 8-10 AM
└── Thursday 8-10 AM

TIER 2 (Good engagement):
├── Monday 8-10 AM (people catching up)
├── Tuesday-Thursday 12-1 PM (lunch scroll)
└── Sunday 7-9 PM (planning for week)

AVOID:
├── Friday afternoon (people checked out)
├── Saturday (low B2B activity)
└── Late night (low dwell time)
```

### Posting Frequency
```
MINIMUM VIABLE: 2-3x/week
OPTIMAL: 4-5x/week
AGGRESSIVE: Daily (only if you can maintain quality)

CONSISTENCY > FREQUENCY
Better to post 3x/week for 6 months than daily for 3 weeks then stop.
```

---

## Section 8: Engagement Strategy

### First 60 Minutes (Critical)
```
1. Post goes live
2. Immediately engage with your own post
   └── Add a comment with additional context or the link
3. Reply to EVERY comment within first hour
   └── Not just "thanks!" — add substance
4. Like and reply to others' posts
   └── Algorithm rewards active users
```

### Comment Quality
```
❌ "Great post!" (adds nothing)
❌ "👏👏👏" (meaningless)
❌ "[link to your thing]" (spam)

✅ "This reminds me of when I [related experience]"
✅ "I'd add [specific insight] to this list"
✅ "Curious about your take on [related question]"
```

### Building Genuine Network
```
1. Find 20-30 people in your niche
2. Engage with their content genuinely (3-5 comments/week each)
3. They'll start seeing and engaging with yours
4. Quality connections > follower count
```

---

## Section 9: Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)

### ❌ The Humble Brag
```
WRONG: "So humbled to be named Top 30 Under 30 while also launching 
        my third successful startup and completing my PhD..."
        
RIGHT: "Got some recognition this week. Still feels weird.
        Here's what I actually struggled with to get here..."
```

### ❌ The Engagement Bait
```
WRONG: "Like if you agree! Comment if you disagree! Share if you 
        love your mom! Follow for more!"
        
RIGHT: End with ONE genuine question relevant to the content.
```

### ❌ The Virtue Signal
```
WRONG: "I always tell my team that work-life balance is important.
        That's why I only work 80 hours a week now instead of 100."
        
RIGHT: Share genuine struggles and what you're actually trying to improve.
```

### ❌ The LinkedIn Lunatic
```
WRONG: "I was waiting in line at Starbucks when I realized...
        [5 paragraphs of corporate buzzwords about disruption]"
        
RIGHT: If a story doesn't have genuine insight, don't post it.
```

### ❌ The Auto-Poster
```
WRONG: Same content cross-posted from Twitter with hashtags intact.

RIGHT: Native content written for LinkedIn's format and audience.
```

---

## Section 10: Guardrails

### What This Skill Does NOT Do
- Create inauthentic engagement bait
- Write corporate jargon or buzzword soup
- Produce "LinkedIn Lunatic" parody content
- Make unrealistic promises about virality
- Encourage posting frequency over quality

### Quality Floors
- Every post must have a genuine insight or value
- Hooks must be honest (not clickbait that doesn't deliver)
- CTAs must be relevant and non-spammy
- Personal stories must have a transferable lesson

### Boundaries
- Will not write posts that misrepresent results
- Will not create fake "I got fired and here's what I learned" stories
- Will not produce content designed purely to game the algorithm
- Will suggest when a topic isn't right for LinkedIn

---

## Section 11: Examples

### Example 1: Build-in-Public Post

**Input:** "Write a LinkedIn post about hitting my first $1K MRR"

**Output:**
```
$1,000 MRR.

It took 9 months.

Here's the honest timeline nobody posts:

Month 1-3: Built features nobody asked for
Month 4-5: Rebuilt based on actual feedback
Month 6-7: $47 MRR, questioned everything
Month 8: Changed pricing, lost 2 customers
Month 9: Found my niche, hit $1K

The turning point?

I stopped building what I thought was cool.
Started building what one specific person needed.

That one person became 3. Then 12. Then 31.

Lesson: Niche down. Way more than you think.

What was your turning point moment?

---

Building [Product] in public — more honest updates in my posts.
```

### Example 2: Technical Insight Post

**Input:** "Write a LinkedIn post about why I switched from MongoDB to Postgres"

**Output:**
```
I migrated 2M documents from MongoDB to Postgres.

Here's why (and what I wish I knew earlier):

MongoDB was perfect for prototyping.
Schema flexibility let me move fast.

But at scale, I hit three walls:

1. Complex queries became nightmare aggregations
2. Joins required multiple roundtrips
3. My data was relational all along

The migration took 3 weeks.
Should've done it 6 months earlier.

Key lesson:

"Flexibility" in the beginning often becomes "mess" at scale.
Start with Postgres unless you genuinely need document storage.

Caveat: MongoDB is great for actual document use cases.
But most CRUD apps? Postgres wins.

What database choices have you regretted?
```

### Example 3: Hot Take Post

**Input:** "Write a LinkedIn post with a contrarian take on hustle culture"

**Output:**
```
"Rise and grind" culture is productivity theater.

I built my best product working 5-hour days.

Here's what I stopped doing:

→ Waking up at 5 AM (I'm not a morning person)
→ "Productive" podcasts while doing other things
→ Saying yes to every networking call
→ Measuring hours instead of output

Here's what I started doing:

→ 3 deep work blocks of 90 minutes each
→ One priority per day, not ten
→ Saying no without elaborate excuses
→ Stopping when the important thing is done

Controversial opinion:

If you need to work 80 hours a week, you might have a strategy problem, not a work ethic problem.

Am I wrong? What's worked for you?
```

## Section 13: Output Requirements

Every LinkedIn post generated MUST include:
1. **Hook** — First 1-2 lines designed for the "see more" truncation
2. **Body** — Structured content with appropriate line breaks
3. **CTA** — Genuine question or invitation, not engagement bait
4. **Formatting** — LinkedIn-native formatting (line breaks, minimal emoji)

Every output MUST end with a contextual follow-up menu.
