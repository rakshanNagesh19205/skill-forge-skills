# UI/UX Usability — Audits & Improvements

## Quick Start

This skill audits existing interfaces and provides actionable fixes using Nielsen's 10 Heuristics.

## When to Use

- Auditing an existing interface
- Fixing UX problems
- Analyzing user flows
- Identifying friction points
- Before/after comparisons

## Nielsen's 10 Heuristics

1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Help users recover from errors
10. Help and documentation

## Severity Scale

- **[1] Cosmetic** — Fix if time permits
- **[2] Minor** — Low priority
- **[3] Major** — High priority
- **[4] Catastrophic** — Must fix

## Quick Triggers

```
audit     → Full heuristic evaluation
fix       → Quick fixes for specific issues
flow      → User flow analysis
friction  → Identify friction points
compare   → Before/after comparison
```

## Output Format

Every issue includes:
- Problem description
- Heuristic violated
- Severity rating
- User impact
- Actionable fix (with code)
