    Edge cases for conducting usability audits and providing fixes.
  
  cases:
    - id: vague_criticism
      scenario: "Audit produces vague feedback"
      naive_failure: "Says 'the UI is confusing' without specifics"
      expert_behavior: "Identifies exact elements and specific issues"
      test_input: "This dashboard feels off, what's wrong?"
      must_check:
        - "Specific elements identified"
        - "Heuristics referenced for each issue"
        - "Location of problems clearly stated"
      anti_patterns:
        - "The dashboard is confusing"
        - "It doesn't feel right"
        - "Generic criticism without specifics"
    
    - id: no_fixes_provided
      scenario: "Identifies problems without solutions"
      naive_failure: "Lists problems but no actionable fixes"
      expert_behavior: "Every problem has a specific, implementable fix"
      test_input: "What's wrong with this form?"
      must_check:
        - "Every identified problem has a fix"
        - "Fixes include code where applicable"
        - "Fixes are specific, not 'make it better'"
      anti_patterns:
        - "This has poor usability"
        - "You should improve the labels"
        - "Criticism without solutions"
    
    - id: ignoring_context
      scenario: "Audit ignores user context"
      naive_failure: "Applies generic rules without considering use case"
      expert_behavior: "Considers the specific user goals and context"
      test_input: "Audit my internal admin tool"
      must_check:
        - "Considers that it's for internal users"
        - "Adjusts recommendations for expert users"
        - "Different standards than consumer app"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Treating admin tool like consumer app"
        - "Demanding consumer-level onboarding"
    
    - id: aesthetic_over_usability
      scenario: "Prioritizes looks over function"
      naive_failure: "Focuses on visual issues when UX is broken"
      expert_behavior: "Prioritizes functional fixes over aesthetic ones"
      test_input: "The colors are ugly and the form doesn't submit"
      must_check:
        - "Prioritizes form submission fix (severity 4)"
        - "Color issues are lower priority (severity 1-2)"
        - "Clear severity ranking"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Let's fix the colors first"
        - "Equal priority to all issues"
    
    - id: missing_positive_feedback
      scenario: "Only negative criticism"
      naive_failure: "Lists only problems, demoralizes user"
      expert_behavior: "Notes what's working well alongside issues"
      test_input: "Audit my landing page"
      must_check:
        - "Mentions positive aspects"
        - "Balanced feedback"
        - "Constructive tone"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Everything is wrong"
        - "Only negative points listed"
    
    - id: no_severity_ranking
      scenario: "All issues treated equally"
      naive_failure: "Lists 20 issues with no prioritization"
      expert_behavior: "Clear severity ranking, critical issues first"
      test_input: "Full audit of my app"
      must_check:
        - "Severity ratings on each issue"
        - "Issues ordered by severity"
        - "Critical vs cosmetic clearly distinguished"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Here are 20 issues" (unsorted)
        - "All issues presented equally"
