    Edge cases for implementing purposeful, Swiss-appropriate animations.
  
  cases:
    - id: decorative_animation_request
      scenario: "User wants gratuitous animation"
      naive_failure: "Implements whatever flashy animation requested"
      expert_behavior: "Suggests purposeful alternative, explains Swiss philosophy"
      test_input: "Make the logo bounce continuously"
      must_check:
        - "Explains why continuous animation is problematic"
        - "Suggests purposeful alternative (hover state, load animation)"
        - "References Swiss motion philosophy"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Here's a bouncing logo animation"
        - "No mention of purpose or restraint"
    
    - id: non_react_environment
      scenario: "User isn't using React"
      naive_failure: "Provides React Bits code anyway"
      expert_behavior: "Offers CSS/vanilla JS alternatives"
      test_input: "Add SplitText to my vanilla JS site"
      must_check:
        - "Notes React Bits requires React"
        - "Provides CSS-only or vanilla JS alternative"
        - "Achieves similar effect without React"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Just install React Bits"
        - "Ignoring the vanilla JS constraint"
    
    - id: missing_reduced_motion
      scenario: "Animation without accessibility consideration"
      naive_failure: "Provides animation without reduced motion fallback"
      expert_behavior: "Always includes prefers-reduced-motion handling"
      test_input: "Add a page transition animation"
      must_check:
        - "Animation code includes reduced motion media query"
        - "Explains why this matters"
        - "Fallback doesn't break the UI"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Animation with no accessibility mention"
        - "Assuming all users want motion"
    
    - id: slow_animation
      scenario: "Animation timing is too slow"
      naive_failure: "Uses arbitrary slow duration"
      expert_behavior: "Follows duration guidelines, explains timing"
      test_input: "Add a 3 second fade in to this card"
      must_check:
        - "Suggests more appropriate duration"
        - "Explains why 3s is too slow for UI"
        - "Provides timing guidelines"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Here's your 3 second animation"
        - "No mention of duration best practices"
    
    - id: performance_heavy_animation
      scenario: "Animation affects layout properties"
      naive_failure: "Animates width, height, margin, etc."
      expert_behavior: "Uses transform/opacity for performance"
      test_input: "Animate the card width on hover"
      must_check:
        - "Suggests transform: scale instead of width"
        - "Explains performance implications"
        - "Provides performant alternative"
      anti_patterns:
        - "transition: width 300ms"
        - "No performance consideration"
    
    - id: too_many_animations
      scenario: "User wants animations on everything"
      naive_failure: "Animates every element"
      expert_behavior: "Recommends restraint, prioritizes key moments"
      test_input: "Add animations to all my cards, buttons, links, and images"
      must_check:
        - "Recommends selective animation"
        - "Prioritizes high-impact moments"
        - "Explains Swiss restraint principle"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Here's animation for everything"
        - "No mention of restraint or prioritization"
