  description: |
    Edge cases for correctly routing users to the right specialized skill.
  
  cases:
    - id: multi_concern_request
      scenario: "User has overlapping needs spanning multiple skills"
      naive_failure: "Picks one skill arbitrarily, ignores other needs"
      expert_behavior: "Identifies all relevant skills, suggests sequence"
      test_input: "I need to redesign my dashboard - it's ugly and has usability issues"
      must_check:
        - "Identifies both uiux-visual AND uiux-usability needs"
        - "Recommends starting with usability audit"
        - "Suggests visual polish after UX fixes"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Just use uiux-visual"
        - "Ignoring the usability concern"
    
    - id: wrong_skill_assumption
      scenario: "User uses wrong terminology for their actual need"
      naive_failure: "Routes based on words used, not actual need"
      expert_behavior: "Clarifies actual need before routing"
      test_input: "I need a design system"
      must_check:
        - "Asks clarifying question about scope"
        - "Distinguishes system foundations from visual styling"
        - "Offers both interpretations"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Immediately routing to uiux-systems"
        - "Not clarifying what 'design system' means to them"
    
    - id: technology_mismatch
      scenario: "User's tech stack differs from defaults"
      naive_failure: "Assumes React when user has Vue/vanilla"
      expert_behavior: "Asks about tech stack, adjusts recommendations"
      test_input: "Add animations to my Vue app"
      must_check:
        - "Notes that React Bits is React-specific"
        - "Offers alternatives for Vue (Vue Bits or manual)"
        - "Doesn't blindly recommend React Bits"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Here's how to use React Bits in Vue"
        - "Ignoring the Vue mention"
    
    - id: vague_request_handling
      scenario: "User gives extremely vague input"
      naive_failure: "Asks generic clarifying questions"
      expert_behavior: "Presents organized options for selection"
      test_input: "help me with design"
      must_check:
        - "Shows numbered skill options"
        - "Doesn't ask open-ended question"
        - "Each option clearly maps to a skill"
      anti_patterns:
        - "What kind of design do you need?"
        - "Please provide more details"
    
    - id: complete_workflow_request
      scenario: "User needs end-to-end project guidance"
      naive_failure: "Routes to single skill"
      expert_behavior: "Outlines multi-skill workflow sequence"
      test_input: "I'm building a SaaS app and need to design everything"
      must_check:
        - "Recommends starting with uiux-systems"
        - "Outlines full workflow path"
        - "Mentions accessibility as final step"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Use uiux-visual for this"
        - "Single skill recommendation only"
