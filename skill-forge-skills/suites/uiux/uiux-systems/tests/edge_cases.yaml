    Edge cases specific to building design systems and token architectures.
  
  cases:
    - id: arbitrary_values
      scenario: "User provides inconsistent spacing values"
      naive_failure: "Uses the arbitrary values as-is"
      expert_behavior: "Maps to nearest systematic value, explains why"
      test_input: "My spacing needs: 7px, 13px, 22px, 47px"
      must_check:
        - "Maps to systematic 4px-based values"
        - "Explains why systematic > arbitrary"
        - "Shows the mapping (7→8, 13→12, etc.)"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Using 7px, 13px directly in tokens"
        - "No explanation of systematic approach"
    
    - id: overused_fonts
      scenario: "User requests Inter or Roboto"
      naive_failure: "Uses Inter/Roboto without comment"
      expert_behavior: "Suggests Swiss-appropriate alternatives"
      test_input: "Use Inter for the typography"
      must_check:
        - "Acknowledges the request"
        - "Suggests alternatives (IBM Plex, Söhne, etc.)"
        - "Explains why Swiss design avoids overused fonts"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Silently using Inter"
        - "No mention of Swiss typography principles"
    
    - id: too_many_colors
      scenario: "User wants extensive color palette"
      naive_failure: "Generates 20+ color variations"
      expert_behavior: "Constrains to Swiss-appropriate palette size"
      test_input: "I need colors for every emotion and state"
      must_check:
        - "Limits to core neutral + 1 accent"
        - "Semantic colors for states (success, error)"
        - "Explains Swiss color restraint"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Here's your 50 color palette"
        - "Purple, teal, orange, pink all as primaries"
    
    - id: missing_semantic_layer
      scenario: "User only wants primitive tokens"
      naive_failure: "Only provides gray-100, gray-200, etc."
      expert_behavior: "Includes semantic layer for maintainability"
      test_input: "Just give me the raw color values"
      must_check:
        - "Provides primitives as requested"
        - "Also includes semantic aliases"
        - "Explains why semantic layer matters"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Only primitive tokens, no semantic layer"
        - "User must figure out when to use gray-600 vs gray-700"
    
    - id: no_dark_theme
      scenario: "User doesn't mention dark mode"
      naive_failure: "Only provides light theme tokens"
      expert_behavior: "Includes dark theme structure by default"
      test_input: "Create a color system for my app"
      must_check:
        - "Light theme tokens provided"
        - "Dark theme structure included"
        - "Explains how to toggle themes"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Only light theme, dark mode as afterthought"
        - "No mention of theming architecture"
    
    - id: wrong_type_scale
      scenario: "User picks non-standard type scale"
      naive_failure: "Uses arbitrary pixel sizes"
      expert_behavior: "Suggests mathematical ratio, explains benefits"
      test_input: "Font sizes: 11px, 14px, 18px, 25px, 40px"
      must_check:
        - "Identifies the approximate ratio"
        - "Suggests standardizing to nearest mathematical scale"
        - "Explains visual harmony benefits"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Using arbitrary sizes without comment"
        - "No mention of type scale ratios"
